# Hi, I'm Musa! 👋

## 🚀 About Me
I'm a Freshman at Hunter college with a passion for computer science. I enjoy exploring technology that can help me expand my knowledge of coding languages, frameworks, and as a developer.

I'm a former senior at MESA Charter High School with a strong academic background in AP courses and membership in multiple honor societies like NEHS, NHS, and NMHS. 

As an IT Fellow, I’ve gained hands-on experience in networking, troubleshooting, and hardware repair. I’ve also completed cybersecurity fellowships, earned certifications, and developed Java programming skills through a summer bootcamp—all building my foundation as a future developer.
